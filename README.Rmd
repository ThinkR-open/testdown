The goal of `{testdown}` is to generate a bookdown report of `{testthat}` results

## Installation

You can install the dev version of `{testdown}` 

- from r-universe

```r
# Enable universe(s) by thinkr-open
options(repos = c(
    thinkropen = 'https://thinkr-open.r-universe.dev',
    CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))

# Install some packages
install.packages('testdown')
```

- from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ThinkR-open/testdown")
```

## About

This package has two exported functions: 

### `test_down()`

This function turns the `{testthat}` results into a `{bookdown}` report. 
It takes:

+ A `project_name`, which is the name you want to give to the project. 
The default is `NULL`, which will then be converted to `basename(here::here())`.
+ An `author`, if you want your report to be have an author name.
Default is NULL, and then the report won't have any name on it.
+ `pkg`, the path to the package that will be documented. 
Default is `here::here()`
+ `environment`, a name for the testing environment.
Default is `here::here()`
+ `book_path`, the folder where you want the `{bookdown}` report to be created. 
Default is `"tests/testdown"`.
+ `with_help` Should the help appendix be added? 
Default is `TRUE`.
+ `open` Should the report be opened once compiled? 
Default is `interactive()`.

### `test_down_example()`

This function will compile the report for an example package contained inside `{testdown}`.

## Custom `{testdown}` roxygen tags

You can add a `description` to your tests using the roxygen tag `@description`.
Note that this test __must__ be on the line just before the expectation. 

Here is an example: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
test_that("hello_world() works", {
  
  #' @description Testing that hello_world("colin") returns "Hello world, my name is colin!"
  expect_equal(hello_world("colin"), "Hello world, my name is colin!")
  
  #' @description Testing that hello_world("colin") returns a character vector
  expect_is(hello_world("colin"), "character")
  
  #' @description Testing that hello_world("colin") has World in it
  expect_match(hello_world("colin"), "World")
  
  #' @description Testing that hello_world("colin") has Hello in it
  expect_match(hello_world("colin"), "Hello")
})
```

```{r child = "inst/testdownhelp.md", eval = TRUE}

```

## Writing custom expectation

For reliable results, all expectations should start by `expect`, notably if you need to count the skipped tests. 
In other words, the skipped expectations count relies on counting all the functions starting with `expect`, so naming custom expectation differently will prevent this count from being correct.  

## Known limitations

`{testdown}` report relies on `{testthat}` and the results are based on these outputs. 

Here are known example of results that will be discarded by `{testthat}` and hence will make `{testdown}` behave in a weird way. 

+ Using `{withr}`

```{r}
test_that("Files exist", {
  with_dir(
    "new/dir",
    {
      #' @description Checking that style.css is created
      expect_file_exists("tests/testdown/style.css")
      #' @description Checking that _bookdown.yml is created
      expect_file_exists("tests/testdown/_bookdown.yml")
      #' @description Checking that _output.yml is created
      expect_file_exists("tests/testdown/_output.yml")
    }
  )
})
```

As testthat doesn't count the expectations from `with_dir`, this will make the `{testdown}` result weird.
Always add the expectations at the top level of your test_that. 

+ Loops

Same goes with for loops:

```{r eval = FALSE}
for (i in names(df)){
    #' @description Checking the names of the output are correct
    expect_true(
      i %in% c(
        "context",
        "test",
        "expectation",
        "description",
        "location",
        "test_time",
        "result",
        "file",
        "message"
      )
    )
  }
```

If ever you use this format, `{testthat}` won't catch the tests, so they won't be reported.

+ HTML expectations

As testdown render the text straight in html, if your expecatation contains html, it will break the rendering. 
For example, the following test will break the rendering:

```{r}
expect_match(
  tag, 
  "<h2>this</h2>"
)
```
